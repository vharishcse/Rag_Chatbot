However, you can avoid application rejection by:\n\n- Applying from only 1 Demat account per PAN\n- Applying at cut-off price\n- Ensuring that the Bank A/c, Demat A/c, and UPI ID are mapped to the same PAN\n\nFor example: Jack is using Jill’s UPI ID to apply for an IPO with his Demat A/c. In such a case, Jack’s application will be rejected because:\n\n- Jill’s bank A/C used is not linked to the Demat A/c of Jack\n- Jill’s UPI ID used is not linked to Jack’s PAN"
"Where can I check my refund status in case of a rejected/non-allotted IPO application?","Banks will simply hold/block your money when you apply for an IPO. So, your funds will be released/unblocked on or before the UPI mandate expiry date. Please reach out to your bank in case funds are not unblocked or released post the mentioned date."
"Why didn’t I get my IPO allotment?","Common reasons why you didn’t get the allotment are:\n\n- Non-Allotment: Allotment is done through lottery system because of over-subscription.\n\n- Rejection: Application can be rejected due to either of the following reasons:\n 1) Application received from multiple Demat accounts having the same PAN\n 2) Bank account Demat account, and UPI ID used for an application not mapped to the same PAN\n 3) Your bid price is lower than the final issue price"

"What are the timings for Intraday Square-Off?","Below are the timings for Intraday Square-Off:\n\nEquity Segment: 3:15 pm\nFutures Options Segment: 3:20 pm\nCurrency Segment: 4:45 pm\nCommodity Segment: 11:15/11:45 pm ( Depending on Daylight Savings Time)"
"Why was my position squared off?","Your position could have been squared off due to any of the below reasons:\n1. Intraday trades will auto squared off at 3:15 pm for the Cash segment and at 3:20 for the F&O segment.\n2. Intraday trades will be squared off if you lose 80% of your Available Margin.\n3. When you don't maintain the minimum required margin in your account your shares will be squared off 4 days after the shortfall occurs.\n4. When your shares bought using Margin are down by more than 50% of your fund balance, square-off will be done on the next trading day.\n5. Shares bought under Margin Product need to be fully paid or pledged, failing which the shared will be squared off after 7 days.\n6. If your account goes under debit/negative balance, then your shares will be squared off after 7 days."
"Why was my Intraday Position not squared off?","Your buy/sell position might not be squared off due to upper/lower circuit in that stock.\nIn case you have bought the stock and the share is in a lower circuit your shares will be sold the next day.\nIn case you have short sold the share there is in upper circuit on the share the shares will be auctioned."
"When I am trying to exit my position or place a Stop-Loss order, why is it being rejected?","It may happen if you have a pending Stop-Loss (SL) or an exit order already. With an already pending stop-loss or exit order, you will need extra funds to be able to place a duplicate SL/exit order. If you do not have this extra fund in your account, then your duplicate exit order will get rejected. That's why we inform you while exiting if there's a Pending SL/exit order against a position, to avoid any duplicate orders and rejections."
"My Stop-Loss (SL) order was triggered but it did not get executed. Why did this happen?","There could be 2 major reasons behind this:\n1. The asset may be lacking a buyer/seller at the defined stop-loss limit price due to a lack of market depth. Orders are queued while they are being purchased or sold.\na. For example: Let's say there are 50 buyers and 100 sellers who are waiting to trade on a scrip at ₹90. Upon reaching ₹90, the first 50 sellers' orders will be executed, and the remaining 50 sellers will have to wait for new buyers. In case you are one of those remaining 50 sellers, your sell order will remain pending if there are no corresponding buyers and vice versa.\n2. The price movement during high volatility does not fulfill certain criteria e.g. suppose you have placed a sell stop-loss with trigger Price at ₹100 and limit price at ₹100. Now imagine that the LTP touched ₹100 (here, the SL would be triggered) and quickly went below ₹100 due to high volatility. The limit price of ₹100 means the stop-loss order would get executed at only ₹100 or more. Now this order will be pending as price is below Rs 100 and execution will happen only when price has reached or crossed Rs 100. Hence your stop-loss order was not executed. Due to this reason, we recommend keeping a sufficient gap between the trigger price and limit price to increase the chances of Stop Loss execution during high volatility.\n\nNote: In order to increase the chances of execution, we keep the default value of the limit price 2 ticks away from the trigger price. This is done so that if the LTP moves rapidly after triggering the order, the limit price shouldn't be a hindrance and the order should still get executed. Also, if you change the pre-set limit price and bring it closer to the Trigger Price, the chances of execution can reduce in cases of volatility."
"My stop-loss order got triggered even though the predefined Trigger Price had not appeared. Why?","Chances are that the market price did hit the stop-loss price, albeit momentarily and without you being able to spot it at that moment. Within a second, prices can change multiple times and not all of them are relayed to the Brokers by Exchange, especially during high volatility. As a result, such momentary price fluctuations are not seen anywhere. Price matching and execution of the orders is done by the Exchanges and not the Broker."
"What is Stop Loss?","Stop-loss is a tool that investors use to minimise the loss in a trade. Some traders define it as an advance order, which triggers an automatic closure of an open position when the stock price reaches the trigger price level.\nStop loss helps minimise losses but also limit profits from a trade."
"What is Trailing Stop Loss?","A Trailing Stop-loss is an order that lets you set a maximum value or percentage of loss you can incur on a trade. If the security price rises or falls in your favour, the trigger price jumps with it at the set value or percentage. If the security price rises or falls against you, the trigger price stays in place depending on the nature of the order."
"How does a Stop-loss get triggered?","Stop-loss can be your real saviour during a volatile market condition. A price level set at the beginning of the trade allows traders to close their position automatically when the stop-loss is reached. Squaring off takes place at the next price available at the trigger price level and helps limit losses."
"What is the 1% rule of trading?","The 1% rule defines the maximum limit of risk one can take in a trade or the risk-per-trade. It implies adjusting your position so that total loss doesn't cross 1% of your trade value when the stop-loss is triggered. The 1% rule helps avoid significant losses."

Let's say there are 100 buyers and 50 sellers waiting to trade in ABC at 100. ABC is currently trading at 105 Rs and after a few minutes, it reaches 100 Rs. Since there are only 50 sellers for 100 Rs, only 50 buyers will be able to buy the script once this price is reached.
